## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to Arx, whether you're adding new cogs, utilities, or improving existing features. Here's how you can get started:

### üöÄ **Adding New Cogs**
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Arx GitHub repository.
2. **Create a New Cog**: Navigate to the `cogs` directory and create a new Python file for your cog. Each cog should be self-contained within a single Python file, so there's no need for a folder or `__init__.py` file.
3. **Add to the __init__.py file**: Review all the imports and formatting of that file and follow it for future cogs.
4. **Implement Your Features**: Write your commands, events, and other functionalities within the new cog. Follow the existing structure for consistency.
5. **Test Your Cog**: Make sure to test your cog locally to ensure it works without issues.
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once everything is working, submit a pull request with a description of what your cog does.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Adding Utility Functions**
1. **Fork the Repository**: As with cogs, start by forking the repository.
2. **Add to `utils` Directory**: If you're adding utility functions, navigate to the `utils` directory and create a new Python file or modify an existing one.
3. **Document Your Functions**: Write clear docstrings for each function to explain what it does and how to use it.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: After testing your functions, submit a pull request with details on the new utilities.

### üìù **Documentation**
- **Add Docstrings**: Make sure all your functions and classes are well-documented.
- **Update the README**: If your contribution adds new features, update the README file to reflect these changes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Development Workflow**
1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to develop in a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
2. **Install Requirements**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. **Run the Bot Locally**: Test your changes locally before submitting them. Ensure you handle exceptions and edge cases. Be sure to use your own token

We appreciate all contributions and will review pull requests promptly. Join us in making Arx the ultimate Discord companion!
